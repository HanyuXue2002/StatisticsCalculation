This is a program to compute statistics of invertible topological excitations, in the research region of condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. It is used in the paper arXiv: 2412.07653 and 2412.01886.

You can use it to compute the statistics $T_p(C,G)$ and $\tau_p(C,G)$ for any simplicial complex $C$ and Abelian group $G$. You can also do computation localized at any region.
